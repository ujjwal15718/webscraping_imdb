Madhavan), an arrogant young advertisement filmmaker who favors capitalism meet. They get stuck with each other on their problem-filled trip from Bhubaneswar to Chennai, giving them a unique opportunity to explore each other's belief system. Themes such as globalization, financial disparity and compassion in present-day India are explored around the two protagonists, while they also find how deeply interconnected their lives are. \u2014Santhosh",

Bhavani Shankar is also against any of his employees indulging in recreation of any kind. When Ramprasad is caught by his boss at a hockey match, he has to invent a twin brother, the clean-shaven Laxman Prasad, to save his job. When Bhavani's daughter falls in love with the clean-shaven Laxman Prasad, and insists on marrying him, and Bhavani insists she should marry Ramprasad, things take a whacky turn.
